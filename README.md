# Express.js Server Crash: Missing Error Handling in Request Body

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where missing error handling for malformed request bodies can lead to server crashes.

## Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/users` endpoint.  It expects a JSON payload containing user information. However, it lacks proper error handling for situations where the request body is missing required fields or is otherwise malformed.

This results in a runtime error when accessing properties of the `req.body` object that might be undefined, causing the server to crash.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that incorporates robust error handling to prevent these crashes.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with a malformed or incomplete JSON body (e.g., missing the `name` field).

Observe that the server crashes.

Now, run `node bugSolution.js` and repeat step 5. The server should gracefully handle the error and respond with an appropriate error message.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling to validate the request body before processing it.  This prevents unexpected crashes and provides informative error responses to clients.
